                <h2 class="qukdescttl">What is Rising Dragon Gamers?</h2>
                    <p class="qukdesc">Rising Dragon Gamers is a social group founded by Trent Smithson as a means to bring people old and young together to play games of many varieties, some of which include card games, board games and VR games.</p>

      
                <h2 class="whojnttl">Who can join?</h2>
                    <p class="whojntxt">Anybody over the age of 13 years of age can join. However, it is recommended you have decent knowledge in the games we play, as it would make your experience easier and far more fun. People of any gender can join, RDG is open to people from all walks of life and that is how it will stay.</p>

                <h2 class="whrettl">Where are we and what do we do?</h2>
                    <p class="whretxt">We're positioned in Bathurst, NSW Australia. More specifically 2 Dry Street, Bathurst NSW 2795. We meet at that location every week to play games. Typically we alternate between Dungeons and Dragons and a new game each week, this is done because our DnD games can go on for a very long time. If you're interested, feel free to drop in, we gather on Sundays at 12PM! </p>
